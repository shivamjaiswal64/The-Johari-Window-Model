# The-Johari-Window-Model

This is the code which creates a Frame to analyse the human emotions.

The specific feature of this project is that It is purely made with AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) of Java. No helps are taken from Swing.
I made this to analyses and face that How our senior Developer faces a lot of difficulty during their own time.

Johari Window Questionnaire
Instructions:
   •Carefully read each numbered item and its statements marked "A" and "B." 
   •Assign a point value to the A and B statements as follows: 
   •The total point value for A and B added together is five (5). 
   •If statement A is most similar to what you would do, mark 5 for A and 0 for B. 
   •If A is not wholly satisfactory, but in your judgment better than B, mark 4 or 3 for A and 1 or 2 for B. 
   •The converse is true: if B is best mark 5 for B and 0 for A and so on
